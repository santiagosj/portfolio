    <h1 class="ubuntu-condensed-regular">About me</h1>
    <div class="content-about">
        <p>I am a passionate web/software developer with a strong focus on continuous learning. My journey began with
            web development and has expanded to include front-end and backend practices. My experiences
            have taught me adaptability and the importance of lifelong learning. I've worked on diverse projects,
            including scalable study frameworks and secure learning environments.</p>
        <p>Looking forward, I aim to deepen my knowledge as full stack developer or even in advanced topics like pen
            testing and network security.
            I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with teams that value flexibility and
            continuous improvement. My goal is to leverage my skills to make meaningful contributions to software
            development while embracing new challenges.</p>
